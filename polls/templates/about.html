      <p>
        For our MSc project, we were tasked with creating a Machine Learning (ML) performance evaluator is essential
          for ensuring that models are not only accurate but also reliable, fair, and efficient. As ML systems are
          increasingly integrated into critical decision-making processes—from healthcare to finance—it's vital to
          rigorously assess how well they perform across different metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1
          score, and even fairness indicators. A performance evaluator provides a structured, consistent way to
          benchmark models, detect potential issues like overfitting or data bias, and guide model improvement. Without
          proper evaluation, an ML model may appear effective during development but fail in real-world scenarios.
          Additionally, an evaluator enables better transparency and accountability, which is crucial for ethical AI
          deployment. It also facilitates reproducibility and communication between stakeholders, allowing data
          scientists, engineers, and non-technical decision-makers to understand and trust model behavior. In conlusion,
          an ML performance evaluator is key to building robust, trustworthy, and impactful AI systems.</p>
